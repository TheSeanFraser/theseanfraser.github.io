After yesterday's flight, the High Park Hawk Watch has now set a season record for highest mass*: an estimated 16,194 kg of raptors. This is largely due to the record setting year for Turkey Vultures (~2kg), which is currently 40% higher than last year's previous record setting total - we're now over 7,600.

Tomorrow looks like it could be another good day at Hawk Hill, stop by to see how many kilograms per hour we can rack up!

*This is a nearly meaningless statistic, it's just for fun.
