As a bit of a challenge, I tried to see how big of a year list I could get for my son during his first year of life - a true *year list*. <!--more--> While he was a newborn, it was very easy to wear him in a carrier and go birding while he napped - many visits to the High Park Hawk Watch happened like this. Around the time he turned six months old, the stroller became our mobile birding station (not a sponsorship, but BOB jogging strollers are incredible for non-paved trails). While he might not have been supportive of our adventures at all times, my son did enjoy getting outside and experiencing nature on a regular basis.

One of the most memorable entries on this list was a Northern Saw-whet Owl, which was seen hunting near a streetlight on a post-dinner, pre-bedtime, mid-winter owling trip. Some other bird highlights of the year were a Barred Owl, an Acadian Flycatcher, and a Connecticut Warbler.

Here is the complete list of 157 species, of which 152 were within High Park. Highlights/rare birds are bolded, species that were not seen in High Park are in italics and have an asterisk. No, he did not actually see or hear most of these birds, but that's why this list is not for him - it's for me.
