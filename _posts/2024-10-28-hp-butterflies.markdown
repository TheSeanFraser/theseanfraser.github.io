Late last year, I became interested in expanding my knowledge about the inhabitants and visitors to High Park. For birders, it seems butterflies is a natural progression once you become familiar with your local birds.

The *ROM Field Guide to Butterflies of Ontario* is a great resource to learn from, but it can be difficult to know what species to study when you don't have any experience or expectations.

Using Bob Yukich's *Butterflies of High Park (September 2022)* paired with the Toronto Entomologists' Association [Ontario Butterfly Atlas](https://www.ontarioinsects.org/atlas/), I created a checklist for all of the butterfly species found in High Park along with a timeine graph of when to expect each species. Knowing which species are in the area and when to find them makes them much easier to study. With this strategy, I was able to find and photograph [38 species of butterfly in High Park during 2024](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?d1=2024-01-01&place_id=153120&subview=table&taxon_id=47224&user_id=theseanfraser).
