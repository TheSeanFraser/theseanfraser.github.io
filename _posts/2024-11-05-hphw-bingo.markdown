Each hawk watching season has a small target in the back of my head - raptor bingo. To get a raptor bingo, you must see all 15 of the regularly observed species in one season. I have luckily been able to accomplish this for each of the four years I have been a counter on Hawk Hill so far.

There is a pattern developing, however. For the last three years, I have been waiting for a Rough-legged Hawk. 
- 2024: Rough-legged Hawk - November 2
- 2023: Rough-legged Hawk - November 7
- 2022: Rough-legged Hawk - November 28
- 2021: Golden Eagle - November 9

Luckily, I was not left waiting for the last few days of the season like in 2022.
