These are some of my featured projects:

### [High Park Hawk Watch Guide](https://theseanfraser.github.io/HPHW/)
Information about the High Park Hawk Watch, such as migration timing for each raptor species, best weather conditions, and so on.

### [Ontario Bird Arrival & Departure Dates](https://theseanfraser.github.io/ontario-arrival-departure-dates/)
A timeline of bird migration for each region in Ontario, highlighting the date of the first "push" of each species.

### [Birdcabulary](https://theseanfraser.github.io/birdcabulary/)
Test your bird sound knowledge with a multiple choice quiz. This is a work in progress, as I am still building the collection of bird sounds. All of Ontario's warblers are available.

### [High Park Butterfly Checklist and Timeline](/butterflies/insects/2024/10/28/hp-butterflies.html)
A checklist of all butterfly species found in High Park, as well as a graph to find out when each species is flying.
