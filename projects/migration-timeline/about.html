    <h3>About Project</h3>
    <p> This project is intended to predict when the highest number of each species starts to arrive in each region of Ontario.
        The methodology based on <a href="http://mikeburrell.blogspot.com/2012/04/guide-to-spring-arrival-dates-in.html">Mike
        Burrell's blog post</a>. Instead of using eBird data from every available year, only the past 20 years (2002 - 2022) were used
        to have a more accurate prediction based on current circumstances.</p>

    <p>All bird data is from eBird.</p>
